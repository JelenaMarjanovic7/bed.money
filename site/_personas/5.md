- Gets paid and spends from their personal bank account
- Saves at a credit union
- As a security measure, ...

| Money Management Strictness | STORES SAVINGS IN ANOTHER BANKING INSTITUTION AS WELL AS A CREDIT UNION |

##### So you have two different banking accounts, why two different, financial institutions?

> I have two because the financial institution that I get paid in directly from my job, that account, I keep it as the account to basically spend money throughout the month. And the next account. I used that as a savings account. The reason for this is because I swipe my Link's card. If it says I don't have cash on me. And there have been instances where it is the money came out twice and it was paid to the store or some times they can be hacked and you could lose all the money in that account. So to prevent losing all of the money that I have, I prefer to put aside, the savings and a different financial institution.

> This is definitely a good, a way to structure, your,  spending accounts from  your savings here. interesting. so two bank accounts.
