##### DID COVID19 PANDEMIC AFFECT THE WAY YOUR CLIENTS PAY YOU?

> Before COVID people paid in cash, now as the government encourages cashless, 99% of my clients are using Mobile Money.
>
> Even I have gone cashless, if you ask me for Rwf 1000, I won't have it because people pay me using Mobile Money.

##### CAN THEY PAY WITH A BANK CARD?

> *What they do is that they'll withdraw their money using mobile banking. Because it's linked with their mobile money, then can just transfer it to their mobile money and then they can pay me with it.*

##### AIRTEL TRANSACTION FEES ARE CHEAPER THAN MTN'S, WHY DO YOU CHOOSE A MORE EXPENSIVE TELECOM NETWORK WHEN THERE'S A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE?

> *So, if you look at the cost-effectiveness, and internet speed, Airtel is the best [in Rwanda].* *The problem is that we have already gotten used to using MTN services. Our friends, families, bosses, clients all use MTN on the daily. It's hard to call someone who won't call you back because they are using another network.*
>
> The reason why we're sticking to MTN is that our people, our friends are on MTN. So, it's hard to tell someone: "Do you have Airtel? I want to send you some money." But as people buy Airtel for internet, they'll end up using it for other services too, like SMS and calling even mobile money.

### PIN SECURITY & DEVICE STORAGE

- Is very conscious about pin security.
- Contact, photos, and videos are always backed up on Google Drive.
- Contacts and media backup and storage are very important to him.
- Feels comfortable to give out his phone number to an app he just downloaded.
- Rarely uses a computer to backup information from phone.
- Would never let a random stranger take his photo on the street.

##### ARE YOU COMFORTABLE GIVING YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO AN APP THAT YOU JUST DOWNLOADED?

> *Yes. I feel comfortable because I download it from the Google Playstore. I think they are reliable, and for security, if someone is to infiltrate my phone they are going to let me know. So I feel okay giving my number like that.*
