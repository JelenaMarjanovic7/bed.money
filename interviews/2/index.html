Rwandan people, pay me through mobile money and bank accounts. Abroad, they sometimes use Western union and some others Wire directly to my bank from abroad, to my local bank account. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Which way is the most preferred way for you to, get the payment?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I would say mobile money is better. Cash would be the best but it can&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t expect cash to be feasiable with my clients. Without physical locations cash is almost impossible. 
					You, don&#39;t expect the person, even if he was in Kigali you can expect him to give you cash in hand.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Why do you think cash would be the best?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Hey, we&#39;re talking about money here. If there was a way someone&#39;s pay me without me being charged any fees to receive or send that money. I will always choose that. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Some people might say, if you have cash, then you&#39;re going to be tempted to spend it.</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s all of the same to me . If I have money on my mobile money, credit card or bank cards. I see use them as much as I use cash.
					If I want to buy something online. I can use a card, or if I want to order something from Vuba Vuba or in other places they can pay by cash or mobile money or bank. So the same.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Of all the places you keep your money where keeps that the most amount of money?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Bank Accounts, that&#39;s where I get, my bigger salary. Otherwise I would say Mobile Money, it has loads of transactions, more than my Bank account. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>What was the easiest way for you to pay someone now that you said a Mobile Money does a lot of transactions? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It&#39;s been two, maybe three months without using cash. So I feel like Mobile Money is this first, and then Bank account and then cash later. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do think you can go a whole month without using cash after COVID-19 ?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>A week maybe or two. It&#39;s impossible with little transactions, like going on the street buy Vegetables or someone knocking on your door, and has fruits and something small like that. they sometimes don&#39;t understand mobile money payments. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Rwanda suggested people to go cashless. Do you think it&#39;s easier when you get, to use mobile money for most of your transactions, except  for those petty transactions?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Well, it was easier until they charged fees to send the money.</p>
					<p>It&#39;s easier to pay by Mobile Money than by cash. If a motor driver was to charge me 1K of transport and then I was to wire him 1k without any other fees to send that money I would chose to send him that money via mobile money  than give it to him cash. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Why do you think that  using mobile money is the easiest way to pay? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>With mobile money you only send  what you need to send.  You don&#39;t have to be stuck with a motor driver or someone whom you&#39;re buying vegetables from, because they sometimes tell you they need to go get change - then you have to wait.</p>
					<p>Let&#39;s say a vendor only wants 200, you have 5K in your pocket, you don&#39;t have the change and you can&#39;t trust the person to give him all your money.</p>
					<blockquote><p>I can relate to this a motobike guy ran away with my 5,000. and I was to pay 700. So this is also  hits close to home. yeah. So going on, those were small transactions.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>With mobile money if he wants 200 , send him 200 , then you walk away. So it&#39;s quick, you don&#39;t have to negotiate. </p>
					<p>Let&#39;s say you on a bike , you ask  the motor driver the number of his mobile money and finish the transaction. By the minute you reach to where you&#39;re going you&#39;re done then you walk away.</p>
					<p>So I can say, its safe.</p>
					<p>I don&#39;t know about quick, but yeah, it&#39;s quick.</p>
					<p>(safe - but not necessarily quick - why?) </p>
					<p>(I like mobile money, because I can avoid problems when its late at night and the driver doesn&#39;t have change. sometimes its difficult to find someone with change, while the driver waits) </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>If you&#39;re about to make a bigger transaction, maybe. buy a fridge, at your house or maybe buy a couch or, you know, some furniture . How do you pay for those bigger transactions? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>With bigger transaction, I&#39;m used to bank accounts. If someone is like my land lord, if he&#39;s ok with bank accounts  for me to pay him the rent, I would enjoy that more than him knocking on my door. Like I want that money. No, I want him to tell me the bank account and then I wire him the money without us meeting or without us having those problems.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>How do you wire them the money on the bank accounts? It sounds like you don&#39;t go to the bank physically. </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I use mobile banking. I have internet backing, but I don&#39;t use it. I don&#39;t know how its used.</p>
					<p>(if I am sending more than 50k, I would ask you for your bank account details) </p>
					<p>I would just transfer the money through my bank, using the phone or sometimes I will go to the bank. We withdraw the money they call it. I will go on ATM card or ATM and then the money, send it to you via another, another bank agent, especially when we don&#39;t use the same. </p>
					<p>Yeah. That&#39;s how I can do that.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>When, you are using the same bank how does mobile banking work?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>They charge you. It&#39;s a smaller amount of money with the same bank, but they charge for the service. How does it work, with just normal procedures just like putting in your password and email .</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do you use an app for the bank?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Becca Mobile, yeah I have it. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Are you able to save money regularly? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Yeah, I do that. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Where do you keep the money that you save?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Mainly with the bank, a company saving account. You can go back and withdraw the money without the time frame that they gave you. So. If you say that you have to sell 50K, they will, withdraw that on your salary.</p>
					<p>You always get money withdrawn. 50 K always. I&#39;ll give you some time that you want to go back and do it, get back your money. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>So is it, is it like in the same bank? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It&#39;s the same bank. Yeah.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do you take like loans from friends or the bank?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I haven&#39;t gotten loans from banks, I fear that, but yeah from my friends.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>When you get a loan from someone, how did they get the money to you? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>If it&#39;s a bigger amount of money they will use bank accounts. So money less than 50 K people tend to use mobile money, above 50k, people use bank accounts because charges are erased . That&#39;s how I do. I deal with my friends and family. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>So that&#39;s the same when someone borrows from you? </h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I would say when someone borrow from me, that&#39;s how they&#39;re gonna have to pay back.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do you have people that rely on you financially?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I have an obligation, I feel responsible to like take care of some of my family members, but if I don&#39;t do it they won&#39;t blame me . I have that responsibility to provide for my sister because she is in school and needs fees paid.</p>
					<p>Yes. To that question. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do you charge any interest on money you borrow to friends?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Charging a friend interest is not something good. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>I understand all the situations are not the same, but on average , how long does it take them to pay you back?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>2 weeks</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>How do you keep track of how much money you have and how much you spend?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I write down all my expenses and all the people that owe me running that people, how many tools.</p>
						<p>It&#39;s my way of like knowing it, but I know it&#39;s not the driver, but I still manage my expenses monthly. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Do you use an app ?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Nope. It&#39;s not an app. It&#39;s just notes in my phone and write down all the things I need to use money for.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>Right now, do you, owe  money to some people?</h5>

					</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>You said it takes them around two weeks on average to pay.  Does it also take you the same amount of time to pay them back?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>It&#39;s the same two weeks or a month. We can just say a month actually, usually when I get paid. </p>
					</blockquote>
				</article>

Otherwise I don&#39;t provide it, but if it&#39;s a social media app like Twitter or Instagram, I know for a fact they will need it to generate my contacts and make me communicate with people.</p>
