					<h5>In your opinion, Which one is better, cash or cashless?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							I'll still prefer cash, but again, you know, there's no doubt that
							we are moving forward into the future and things are getting
							easier. I personally prefer cash. It's really hard to really
							manage money when you're like paying online or cashless. When you
							have cash on you, you can see it. And it's like, Oh, damn, I only
							have 500 or 1000 remaining, but you know, being online and all
							that. It‚Äôs really tough to manage how much you spend.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sometimes you find out that, you have pay way more than you
							should. you have really over spent because I'm used to that thing
							of having cash in my hand. I'm a young person, I so out sometimes;
							so let's say if I take 30,000 and say I'm gonna buy drinks. If
							Have 30,000 in my hand, I can really easily controll how much I'm
							spending, you can feel the wallet gettign smaller. But if you're
							paying online, you realize you have to pay 50,000 or more and you
							be like: Oh My God, I've really overspent.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h5>
						How do you send/receive money abroad?
					</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Mostly when it's work-related, I'm gonna use our work Bank
							Account. So, tha's official but if it's a personal thing I use
							that thing from Kenya...

						How do you feel when an application, asks you for a phone number?
						Are you hesitant to give them your phone number or do you just give
						it to them without thinking twice?
					</h5>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Because AudioMack is like really a big app all over the globe. So
							it all comes back to the reputation. You know, if it's a new app
							or some app that nobody knows. I don't really give them my number,
							because you know, someone might be hacking my Mobile Money.
							HOwever, if it's really like a incredible app like AudioMack, or
							instagram, you know Instagram asks for your number; then I'll just
							give it. I won't be hesitating.
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a time she really really needed money and I have to give
							her the account credentials.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h5 class="mb0">
						Have you ever given your possword to someone, this might be your
						Google account or any other account in the apps you use?
					</h5>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Only one person, my little sister.
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a time she really really needed money and I have to give
							her the account credentials.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h5 class="mb0">
						So let's say your phone needs repairs, for example, and you go to a
						repair shop and they tell you to give them your phone's password;
						Would you give it to them?
					</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The only place I've ever given it... There's this place called
							CarlCare which is really credible. It's an international
							organization actually. That's where I'll only be comfortable to
							give out my password. Because for them they are professionals.
						</p>
						<p>
							And of course you sign; there's a place where you sign and in case
							they misuse the password, you can sue them and take them to court.
						</p>
						<p>Someone can even have 2 Gmails or use Dropbox.</p>
