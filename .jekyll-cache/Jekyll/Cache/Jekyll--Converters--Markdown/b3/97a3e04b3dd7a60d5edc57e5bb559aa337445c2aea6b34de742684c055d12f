<h5 id="do-you-prefer-cash-or-cashless">DO YOU PREFER CASH OR CASHLESS?</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll still prefer cash but, there’s no doubt that we are moving forward into the future, things are getting easier. It’s really hard to manage money when you’re paying online or cashless. When you have cash you can see it and realise, Oh, damn, I only have 500 or 1000 remaining.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you find out that, you have really over spent. I’m a young person, I go out sometimes; if I have 30,000 in my hand, I can really easily control how much I’m spending, you can feel the wallet getting smaller.</p>

  <p><em>Depends on the reputation. AudioMack is a big app all over the globe. You know, if it’s a new app or some app that nobody knows, I don’t really give them my number, because someone might be hacking my Mobile Money.

  <p>There’s this place called CarlCare which is really credible. It’s only place I’ve ever given it… It’s an international organisation actually. That’s where I’ll only be comfortable to give out my password. Because they are professionals.</p>

  <p>There’s [a contract] where you sign and in case they misuse the password, you can sue them and take them to court.</p>
