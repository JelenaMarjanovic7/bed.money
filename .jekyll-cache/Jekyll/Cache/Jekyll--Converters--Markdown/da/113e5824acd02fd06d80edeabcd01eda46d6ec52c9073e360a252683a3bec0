<blockquote>
  <p>What I do is translation services for different clients in Rwanda, and elsewhere in the world. So there are different ways they pay me. Rwandan people, pay me through mobile money and bank accounts. Abroad, they sometimes use Western union and some others wire directly to my local bank account.</p>

<h5 id="why-do-you-think-that-using-mobile-money-is-the-easiest-way-to-pay">WHY DO YOU THINK THAT USING MOBILE MONEY IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PAY?</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>With mobile money you only send what you need to send. You don’t have to be stuck [waiting for change] with a motor driver or someone whom you’re buying vegetables from.</p>

  <p>Let’s say he only wants 200, you have 5K in your pocket, you don’t have the change and you can’t trust the person to give him all your money. With mobile money if he wants 200, send him 200, then walk away. So it’s quick, you don’t have to negotiate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are these apps that you know, for sure that they need it, you always understand the logic behind it. Otherwise I don’t provide it, but if it’s a social media app like Twitter or Instagram, I know for a fact they will need it to generate my contacts and make me communicate with people.</p>

  <p>That’s why they need my contact information. If it is a dictionary, come on. Why do you need my names and things to give me a dictionary?</p>

  <p>I would go back and delete some things or transfer some of my things to some of the other accounts. You know, there are so many other ways you can, can have them online.</p>

  <p>Someone can even have 2 Gmails or use Dropbox.</p>
